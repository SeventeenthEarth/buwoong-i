# Buwoong-i ü¶â

> The name "Buwoong-i" (Î∂ÄÏóâÏù¥) is the Korean word for owl.

## Overview

A Python-based utility that scans project directories to find files with specific extensions (`dart`, `py`, `sql`) as well as `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml/yml`. It compiles these findings into a comprehensive Markdown (`.md`) document containing metadata (file counts and directory trees) along with the content of each file.

This tool is particularly valuable for documenting code directories, providing a readable format of source code, and creating clear, structured archives of codebases. It's especially useful for code reviews and analysis with AI, as it facilitates easy sharing of entire codebases.

## Features

- **File Discovery**
  - Scans for `.dart`, `.py`, `.sql` extensions
  - Locates `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml/yml` files

- **Metadata Generation**
  - Creates comprehensive directory statistics
  - Generates clear directory structure trees
  - Collects and organizes file contents

- **Document Organization**
  - Produces well-structured Markdown output
  - Supports custom title configuration
  - Enables easy setup through `input.yaml`
  - Neatly organizes output in a dedicated directory

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.

Install the required packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Configure the tool through an `input.yaml` file:

```yaml
title: PROJECT_NAME
extension: PROJECT_LANGUAGE
path: PROJECT_PATH
exclude_dir:
  - setup
  - ...
```

## Usage

Run the tool with this command:

```sh
python main.py -i input/[input].yaml
```

### Arguments in input.yaml:
- `title`: (Optional) Custom title for your Markdown file. If omitted, uses the last directory name
- `extension`: File extension to search for (`dart`, `py`, or `sql`)
- `path`: Directory path to scan
- `exclude_dir`: (Optional) Directories to exclude from documentation

## Output

Generated files are saved in an `output` directory, following this naming convention:

```
[title_or_last_directory]_[timestamp].md
```

Where `title_or_last_directory` is your chosen title or directory name, and `timestamp` marks the creation time in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format.

## Directory Structure

The generated Markdown document contains:

1. **Header**: Identifies the documented directory or custom title
2. **Metadata Section**: Presents file counts and directory structure
3. **Code Section**: Displays file contents with clear headers showing paths

## Development

Built with Python using the `os`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `yaml`, and `typer` libraries. The lightweight design makes it simple to maintain and modify.

Feel free to adapt the code to support additional file types or modify the output format according to your needs.
